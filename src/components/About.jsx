        <p className="pb-8">My interest in coding began back in the early 2000s, when Geocities and MySpace were popular. I never thought that customizing a MySpace page would lead to teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and b2/WordPress/Greymatter just to put together a blog.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I'm most likely traveling the world with my current job as a flight attendant, taking care of my house plants, hiking, watching true-crime documentaries, or learning new languages like Java and Russian. :3</p>
